## The Problem it Solves
It is a decentralised crypto donation platform with the unique factor that funds are stored in a smart contract and we verify the receiver with an aadhaar card anonymously, once we are able to map users to their cause(s), It is then registered in the recipient list, once the target of the fund is met, the funds will be directly sent into recipient's account

It is more than just a charitable initiative; It's a pioneering approach to humanitarian aid. By leveraging the unique benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, it addresses many of the inefficiencies and trust issues of traditional donation systems, ensuring that aid is timely, transparent, and reaches those who need it most.

1. Transparency and Trust - Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, allowing donors to see exactly where their funds are going and how they are being used.
2. Efficient and Rapid Response - Crypto donations can be transferred almost instantly, ensuring that aid reaches the affected areas or individuals without the delays inherent in traditional banking systems.
3. Global Reach -  Cryptocurrencies operate on a global scale without the need for intermediaries. This allows for borderless donations, enabling people from anywhere in the world to contribute easily.
4. Empowerment of Recipients - Decentralized funds can potentially offer more direct forms of aid, such as cryptocurrency transfers to individuals, empowering them to use the funds as they see fit for their specific needs.
